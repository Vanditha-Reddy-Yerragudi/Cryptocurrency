# Algorithmic Trading Model for BTC/USDT Cryptocurrency Market

# Objective

This project develops algorithmic trading models for the BTC/USDT cryptocurrency market, focusing on statistical and machine learning techniques to predict trends and optimize returns while considering transaction costs and slippage.

# Key Features
Data Acquisition: Historical BTC/USDT data is loaded from a CSV file for analysis and modeling.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed, handling missing values and preparing features.

Modeling:  Random Forest Classifier (Used to predict market trends and generate trading signals).
   
Backtesting and Metrics: Simulates performance considering transaction costs (0.2%) and slippage (0.5%).

Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to generate insights from the data and model performance.

# Implementation Details

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Transaction Costs and Slippage: Integrated into the backtesting process for realistic evaluation.

Data Used: A dataset containing historical price and volume data.

# Repository Contents

Code: Implementation in crypto.ipynb, including data loading, preprocessing, and model training.

Sample Dataset: BTC-USD.csv (Replace dataset_path in the code to run locally).

Results: Key metrics and visualizations for trading performance.

# Usage Instructions

Clone the repository and open crypto.ipynb.

Place the dataset at the specified dataset_path.

Run the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
